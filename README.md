# LeetCode SQL Solutions

A growing collection of my **LeetCode Database (SQL) solutions**, focused on writing correct, efficient queries and strengthening real-world query skills.

This repo is dedicated to SQL only, so I can practice:
- query logic and clarity
- joins, grouping, filtering, and window functions
- writing solutions that are both correct and readable

---

## What You'll Find

- Solutions to LeetCode SQL / Database problems
- Clear formatting and readable query structure
- Comments when a query has a tricky idea (window functions, ranking logic, edge cases)

---

## Skills Practiced

Topics include:
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- `JOIN` types (INNER / LEFT / SELF JOIN)
- Aggregations (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `PARTITION BY`)
- Date/time operations
- NULL handling

---

## Conventions

- One problem per file (or folder if you prefer grouping)
- Recommended naming:
  - `####-problem-name.sql`
- Queries are formatted for readability:
  - consistent indentation
  - meaningful aliases
  - clear step-by-step CTEs when useful

## Goal

The goal isn’t just to pass test cases, but to build SQL depth by solving more challenging query problems and learning patterns that transfer directly to analytics and backend work.
